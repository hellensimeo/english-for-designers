## Storytelling

[Presentation](Storytelling/storytelling.pdf)

#### 1st slide:

Hello everybody, I welcome you here at this presentation that is going to be about something that I see as a good reason to become a graphic designer.

#### 2nd slide:

To anyone missing their lenses today, I'm Helena, and coincidentally, I have become a designer myself in the past three years.

What I especially enjoy about it is selling stuff and telling visual stories.
I helped to raise over 1 mil. Kč for my favourite non-profit organisation.
And by doing graphic design, saved a marriage once or twice.

#### 3rd slide:

A dear friend of mine once said that I could sell her her own shoes if I wanted.
And today, I'd like to tell you about the kind of trouble that mindset usually gets me into.

#### 4th slide:

A story of the toughest job I've ever done.

#### 5th slide:

It all started over 20 years ago, when my mum met my dad and they had a firm.

They started teaching qi-gong. Never heard of it? Yeahhh... that's going to change soon.
BUT meanwhile I'll explain it like this: Imagine going to a gym. What is it that you want to do in there? Exercise? Build muscles?

Qi-gong does the same thing in a completely different way. It uses muscles to split ATP, it helps inner organs and therefore biochemical energy move.
And that is why you've probably never heard of it – it literally works with energy. ((Weird, right?))

#### 6th–9th slide:

And as far as I remember, my parents had divided roles in the business.
My mum focused on the content. She always tries to bring something new to the clients, and my father likes to sell it.

#### 10th–14th slide:

For years I wondered... how could any content about an exercise that is used, for instance, in France as an additional cancer treatment, beat such a magnificent piece of visual storytelling?

#### 15th slide:

...

#### 16th–17th slide:

My mum doesn't like Facebook. She doesn't go there.
Yet it still surprised me when I heard her say that people are getting weirder every year.

#### 18th–19th slide:

A year later, they started to drink toadstool potions and bring magic stones to the lessons.

#### 20th–21st slide:

Then they started to expect my parents to do magic.

#### 22nd slide:

So before launching a new product, my mum came up with a bulletproof website where she ((over))explained what qi-gong is.
Why it is amazing, who it is good for, that it is no magic, and so on.
So that people would finally understand what it really was.

#### 23rd slide:

And then a bad thing happened.

#### 24th slide:

You might be asking: what what? Who the f* is your father?
Well, my father is a judge. When someone wrongs you, he is the person that might fight for you at the European Court of Human Rights.
That's how well-educated and trusted a person he is.

#### 25th–26th slide:

So why does the qi-gong program that is accredited by the Ministry of Education—a school that helped thousands of people—present itself the way we saw?

There is just one good explanation: because my dad is a hobby-graphic designer.

#### 27th slide:


I've spent the last 6 months trying to fix this situation.
And trust me, I've faced so many interesting situations.
So if you're interested, please come and join me at Obhajoby.
But I can show you a small trailer.

#### 28th–29th slide:

#### 30th slide:

Over the course of this project, I had to take many roles—
marketing strategist, photographer, illustrator, copywriter, director, scriptwriter, fashion consultant, make-up artist, photo and video editor, motion and sound designer, book typographer, UX/UI designer... and of course, graphic designer.

And I've learned one thing.

#### 31st slide:

That designers have the power to save people, and that is something I see as a good reason to be one.

#### 32nd slide:

Thanks!
