Ahoj!

My name is Helena, but some of you may know me as Hellen Simeo - graphic designer with a sharp eye for creative solutions. I focus on design that’s smart, clear, and gets results. I can help you create product experience that works.

I’m just finishing my studies of Graphic Design at VŠKK (Prague university of creative communication). I’m working as a designer for a few small, impactful brands. Outside of work, I’m an energetic person that enjoyes good music and sports.

I’m always open to new projects — one of them could be yours.
