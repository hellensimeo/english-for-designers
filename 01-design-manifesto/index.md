# Design Manifesto

#### Design for People, Not Users
Borrowing words from [37signals](https://37signals.com) - let's think about real people. I always try to create something that genuinely improves the experience of those who interact with it. (I MAY EVEN LEARN TO CREATE A USERFLOW BEFOR CREATING THE WEBSITE ONE DAY)

#### Simplicity Speaks Truth
As [Flusser](http://thepoliticsofdesign.com](https://seansturm.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/about-the-word-design-by-vilem-flusser/)) and 37signals point out, simplicity has power. Complexity can obscure meaning, but simplicity reveals it. Good design should cut through the noise and convey what matters most, clearly and effectively. Whether solving a problem or delivering a message, simplicity helps people engage and understand.

#### Ethical Design is the Only Design
Design isn’t neutral—it’s a choice that impacts people’s lives. Influenced by thinkers like Flusser and [Ruben Pater](http://thepoliticsofdesign.com), I believe that every design decision carries weight. We need to consider the broader implications of our work: Are we empowering or manipulating? Each design should reflect the world we want to live in.

#### Design is Never Done
I as well, see design is an ongoing process, not a final product. It’s about learning, adapting, and evolving. Just like with the unexpected response to my poster, I’m always open to feedback and change. As 37signals says, “Make progress, not perfection.” Every project is an opportunity to learn and improve, and that’s what drives me forward.

#### Design is About Creating Change
I believe that design is a service to society. And like any service, it should be done with intention—it should serve people well.

#### Design with Transparency, Not Tricks
Design should be honest. People deserve to know exactly what they’re interacting with—no hidden agendas or manipulative tactics. Like 37signals, I stand by the principle that design should respect people’s intelligence. It should be a transparent process, not a game of smoke and mirrors.
