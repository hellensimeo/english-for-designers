## About me

### For anyone:

I like a challenge and can quickly get to grips with a wide range of topics. I can process, analyze and, most importantly, retell them to different target groups.

My broader portfolio includes packaging, branding, campaign development, board game design, book and magazine typesetting, and digital design. I’m finishing my studies of Graphic Design  at VŠKK (Prague university of creative communication). I’m working as a designer for  a few small, impactful brands.

### Recruiters:

I master the holy trinity: Ai, Ps and Id. I bring my projects to life in After/Premier Pro and Figma. 
Today, I showcase my designs using a variety of AI models as powerful tools to illustrate my ideas. My favorite thing about my business is working in a team. 
And in my spare time I like to animate - in Procreate.


I’m always open to new projects
— one of them could be yours.
