## About

Ahoj! I'm Helena - graphic designer that likes to sell stuff and tell visual stories. 

My goal? Helping you sell your products and create experience that works. I’m good at creating design that’s smart, funny, and gets results.
I’m just finishing my studies of Graphic Design  at VŠKK (Prague university of creative communication). I’m working as a designer for  a few small, impactful brands, like Umění energie, Akademie čchi-kung.

I’m always open to new projects
— one of them could be yours.
