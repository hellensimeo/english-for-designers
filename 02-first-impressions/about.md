## About me

### For anyone:

Hi, I'm Helena!

a graphic designer who likes to sell stuff, tell visual stories, and bitedestroy new soft-wood pencils while thinking ((again...)).

I work with people who are great at what they do, but don’t always know how to show it. I have an eye for what looks good and what doesn’t, so I can save you a lot of time and money.

Understanding people is my favorite overthinking discipline. So whether your people read tarot, court files, or (usually) not at all, I’ll make a picture speak a up to a 1000 words _to them_.

See, you should really hire me (_and hide your pencils_).

### Recruiters:

I master the holy trinity: Ai, Ps and Id. I bring my projects to life in After/Premier Pro and Figma. 
Today, I showcase my designs using a variety of AI models to illustrate my ideas. And in my spare time I like to animate - in Procreate.


I’m always open to new projects
— one of them could be yours.
