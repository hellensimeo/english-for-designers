## About

Ahoj! I'm Helena - graphic designer that likes to sell stuff and tell visual stories. 

I like a challenge and can quickly get to grips with a wide range of topics. I can process, analyze and, most importantly, retell them to different target groups.
My broader portfolio includes packaging, branding, campaign development, board game design, book and magazine typesetting, and digital design.

I master the holy trinity: Ai, Ps and Id. I bring my projects to life in After/Premier and Figma. 
And I also display my designs today by working with a number of AI models. My favorite thing about my business is working in a team. 
And in my spare time I like to animate - in Procreate.
