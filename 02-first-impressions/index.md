## Ahoj!

I'm Helena - graphic designer that likes to sell stuff and tell visual stories. 

My goal? Helping you sell your products and create experience that works. I’m good at creating design that’s smart, funny, and gets results.
I’m just finishing my studies of Graphic Design  at VŠKK (Prague university of creative communication). I’m working as a designer for  a few small, impactful brands, like Umění energie, Akademie čchi-kung.

I’m always open to new projects
— one of them could be yours.

## E-pravo

Rebranding
### Meaningful project title that tells me something more about the project - Epravo

Working on the redesign of EPRAVO.CZ Magazine was a challenge! Our task was to come up with  a creative solution for an inherently (little changing) formal space. The current design corresponds to the time and purpose it fulfilled  25 years ago - an information medium. Today, the printed form of the magazine has a different role.  It points to prestige. 

Epravo has become a platform for the opinions and achievements of leading Czech lawyers. The design goal was to combine modern design with content that is full of erudition and professionalism.

Client review: The 1st best rated design out of 10 studio designs. The client finally decided not to make any changes for the time being.
Authors: Helena Simonová, Klára Svobodová (front cover)
Project scope: Colour . Redesign of logo . Design of m. 7 sections . Typesetting 25 sample pages
