## Best rated design for E-pravo

Magazine typesetting

<img src="images/HS-tennis.jpg" alt="drawing" width="900"/> 

Working on the redesign of EPRAVO.CZ Magazine was a challenge! Our task was to come up with  a creative solution for an inherently (little changing) formal space. The current design corresponds to the time and purpose it fulfilled  25 years ago - an information medium. Today, the printed form of the magazine has a different role.  It points to prestige. 

Epravo has become a platform for the opinions and achievements of leading Czech lawyers. The design goal was to combine modern design with content that is full of erudition and professionalism.

#### Creators: 

Helena Simonová, Klára Svobodová (front cover)

- Colour
- Redesign of logo
- Design of 7 sections
- 25 sample pages
