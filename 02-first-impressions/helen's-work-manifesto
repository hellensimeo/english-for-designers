# Helen's Work Manifesto

#### Let's bring that "What If" to Life
Are you ready to take your brand to the next level? I’ll partner with you to understand your vision, story, and audience. I'll craft a product experience that resonates with your audience. With my diverse skills in design, storytelling, and strategy, we'll choose the best tools that work - for you. Build something that aligns with your brand and speaks to your goals.

#### Offline is the New Luxury
There is no better way to speed up the start of a new collaboration than to meet in person. By stepping into your world, I can craft a communication style that sounds like *you* and speaks to *them*. For that I have to get to know you / your project well. 
<br><br>

#### Design with Transparency, Not Tricks
A brand or product is an answer. My job is to search for the question behind it: who asked? Who wants what we offer? This isn’t just about understanding your customers—it’s about avoiding manipulation. 

* When it comes to selling, always ask yourself, “If the other person had the same information as me, would they make the same decision?” Ethical, transparent sales not only build lasting relationships—they strengthen your business.
<br><br>

#### Ethical Design
* The secret to a great buying experience is always a story. *It’s the story of the brand I’m supporting, who I’ll become when I buy your product, or how I’ll feel holding it in my hands.*

Together, we won’t invent these stories—we’ll find them. I’ll help you discover what to communicate and create a design that speaks to your audience. Authentic stories build trust and loyalty AND THAT helps your brand grow.
<br><br>


#### Do you really want me to "make the logo bigger"? 
I'll always listen to your feedback. But I’m also here to offer professional advice that serves your brand’s goals. At the end of the day, it's about trust. And you can trust me to be transparent, and to always have your brand's best interests in mind.

**Roses are `#ff0000`,<br>**
**Violets are `#0000ff`,<br>**
**If you’re lost in translation,<br>**
**communication will lose too.<br>**

Design should speak to you—and for you. Being a professional designer doesn’t mean I speak in code. Part of my job is to convey my craft to you - in a useful and understandable way. 
<br><br>

#### Design: A Flexible Journey 
Design isn’t set in stone—it’s a journey. Instead of following a rigid, one-way “waterfall” plan, I prefer a more adaptable approach called Agile. This means we collaborate in flexible phases, learning and refining as we go. It keeps projects responsive, so we can respond to feedback and adapt along the way. In design, flexibility is strength.
<br><br>

#### Thinking globally acting locally
I’m drawn to brands that care about the impact they have on the world. I work best with clients who are mindful of their footprint. Together, we create work that resonates on a local level but carries a global impact.
<br><br>

#### I believe in life after work 
Flexible hours are my specialty! You can count on me to be responsive even during non-standard hours, just leave a message if I don't pick up immediately. I'll get back to you ^^
<br><br>

Now - Let’s create something great together.
