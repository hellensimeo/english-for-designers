# Crafting a casestudy

## CZECH TENNIS
### A fragmented sport in need of a strong identity

A new visual style that brings together a community that is otherwise every man for himself.
The goal of the project was to create a strong and memorable brand that could represent Czech
professional tennis players at tournaments around the world as well as bring together enthusiastic
tennis amateurs.

### Beyond the logo: A full-scale transformation

#### Typography with the right spin

#### Game, set, merch

#### Tennis in your pocket (app)

#### Web for all who score

#### Breaking the net (social media)

### Results
