## Background  
We had no time to start small. [ČTS](https://www.cztenis.cz) is the last sport waiting for a rebrand, and everything needed to change—immediately. The ČTS (Czech Tennis Association) was facing financial scandals. Leadership changes! And definitely a damaged reputation. The project was a chance to reset Czech tennis. Giving it an identity that could unite both professionals and everyday players.  Making it recognizable on courts around the world. 

__Goal of the project__

Rebuild the public image and identity of Czech Tennis — fast

__My team__

Our team consisted of four graphic designers - Filip Kovalský, Tomáš Jindrák, Marharyta Reviakina and me.

__Role__

Graphic designer | Motion designer | Project manager

__Dates__

April 2024 

## Process

We sat down with our client and looked at how other Czech sports had transformed — new logos, national colors, and lions..? _"No lions for us."_, said the client. 

>(And we said, "Aha?"))

So we started brainstorming. Sketch after sketch, idea after idea — some wild, some weird, some already forgotten. 

<sub>(((We had a (Miro) board full of directions, and none of them felt quite right.)))<sub>

We were one round of presentations to not winning the "client" over.

And then it clicked. Our design was clean, modern, and — most importantly — ready to move. 

While other teams focused on static visuals, we leaned into motion from the start. Our identity was designed to live in movement, just like the sport it represented.

### Beyond the logo: A full-scale transformation

#### Game, set, merch
Proud tennis fans will appreciate the new merch, which is written not only on badges, headbands and wristbands but also directly on tennis jerseys. The visual identity is written across the players' equipment. So it's always in plain sight and contributes to connect the community of tennis players  and spectators.

#### Tennis in your pocket (app)
>„Tenis ten máme my Češi v kapse.“
>(Czechs have tennis in the pocket =  we nailed it.)

As part of the rebranding, we also worked on a new Czech Tennis app. It provides tennis fans with an overview of current matches, results and a map of courts where they can go to play.

#### Web for all who score
As part of the project, the ČTS website also underwent a major transformation. Its new design is based on simplicity and clarity. A few clicks are now enough to access all important information and functions. Easy to navigate and navigation on the website is nowadays is the standard for successful communication.

#### Breaking the net (social media)
Our take: Instagram posts directly through the network.The goal is to reach as wide a base of tennis fans as possible. New posts are therefore divided into three categories: daily posts with information, inspirational posts where ambassadors and famous players explain tennis to kids and teenagers, and interesting facts about the world of tennis and its history.

### We are keeping score
The project was named the overall best-rated work and earned a spot at the Náplavkka exhibition to represent VŠKK. 

> VŠKK (prague school of creative communication) is a college specializing in creative fields such as media communications. The Náplavkka exhibition itself serves as a platform to showcase the best student projects, allowing them to reach a broader audience and highlighting the significant impact of well-executed design.
